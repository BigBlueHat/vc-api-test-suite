# [VC HTTP API](https://transmute-industries.github.io/vc-http-api/)

The following is a set of standard http api definitions for contructing and verifying objects which conform to the [VC Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/).

This API is not meant to be exposed directly over http without authorization.

Implementations may not support all endpoints defined by this specification.

### Holder APIs are optional, many implementations will not need them.

However they are really useful for testing purposes, and cases where you don't have WebKMS.
